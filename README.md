## Approach

Followed mobile-first design approach.

## Layout

Followed wrapper approach for layout in the form of container and content. For Example : Container "Shell" contains "Side Nav, Header and Content" .

## Design Pattern (Mobile)

Tried to follow "Instagram and LinkedIn layout" approach for mobile design, where for mobile we have one container works as footer which basically contains quick access to some options.
Side Navigation and footer containing icons are visible for mobile layout only.

## Note

This application mainly focused on Layout and Design.
This can be much optimized.
Many links and icons does not contain any functions and routings.
